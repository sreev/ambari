<body>
<p>
This package defines the entities (messages) for Ambari's REST
interface. The primary two are <a href="Stack.html">Stack</a>, which
defines what needs to be deployed and how it should be configured,
and <a href="ClusterDefinition.html">ClusterDefinition</a>, which
binds a set of nodes to a given stack.
</p>

<p>
These entities are defined
using JAXB and thus can be represented as either XML or JSON with a
very simple mapping. Each of the top level entity classes in this package 
have the
<a href="http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html">compact RelaxNG</a>
schemas for their type.
</p>

<p>
 Any new classes that are added, must be manually inserted into 
 org.apache.ambari.controller.rest.resources.ContextProvider.
